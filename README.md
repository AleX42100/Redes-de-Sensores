# Redes-de-Sensores

## Practical Work

Here you will find all the Codes & Results from the Practical Work in the subject "Redes de Sensores", Master in Electronics of UNIZAR University (Zaragoza, Spain). 
The files are organized in this way: Practica X (where X is the numero of the session relative to the .docx of the Practical sessions, present in this Git also)
In each of them : X.x (x is the number of the question in the Guide)
In this folder there is the corresponding Arduino Code (.ino) and eventually a Python code, depending of the question
In certain cases there will also be a Word document with explanations of the code and results ; because I am on a Mac, some software recomanded in the Guide is not available.. I had to adapt with what I had. 

## Project

There is also a folder named 'Proyecto', where all the ressources, analysis and explaination will be found.
