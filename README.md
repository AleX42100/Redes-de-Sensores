# Redes-de-Sensores

Here you will find all the Codes & Results from the Practical Work in the subject "Redes de Sensores", Master of UNIZAR. 
The files are displayed in this way: Practica X (where X is the numero of the session relative to the .docx of the Practical sessions)
In each of them : X.x (x is the number of the question)
In this folder there is the Arduino Code (.ino) and eventually a Python code depending of the question
In certain cases there will also be a Word document with explanations of the code and results ; because I am on a Mac, some software recomanded in the Guide is not available.. I had to adapt with what I had.
